# BinaryImageClassification
Computer vision project to create a binary image classification program that specifically uses a small, self made dataset.

Read the CV paper for more information on why this exists and how it works. The below section exists to explain the functionality of each program as well as intended use.

# FOR INTENDED USE
This program was never intended to be more than a proof of concept. The code itself has many issues that I would not leave if it was a product I had intended others to use for actual use. If you plan on using this code, be warned that it was specially designed around the filesystem I had been using and WILL require you to alter many lines of code to get working with your own dataset. User discression is advised, as is basic understanding of python programing.

# Binary_Image_Classification
This is the important program. It is able to create a neural network that identifies a pose from a set of images. A description from the paper is below.

It starts by defining classifier as a Sequential from kreas.models. This refers to the type of method it uses internally to represent the network. Next we add 2d convocation to that network. The shape of the convocation changed often through development as I tinkered with the neural network. I flatten the classifier and add several different layers, most importantly ending with a sigmoid with a single unit to make the network output only a 0 or a 1 to determine if it is detecting the pose or not. I compile the classifier with the adam optimizer which is a stochastic gradient descent, meaning as new data points are added it optimizes based on the gradient of changes. The loss function is binary cross entropy, something I truthfully donâ€™t understand too well, however showed the best results. I also have it display accuracy by adding it as a metric.
The image generators in the next part of the code are there to create even more images from the limited dataset available. They will flip, rotate, scale, and blur the images and add them as additional data points. After all is said and done, I fit the neuralnetwork to the set. I use 5 epochs because each epoch takes a long time to complete, but one is not reliable enough. Afterwords I save the classifier as a .h5 so I can re-use it later without needing to compile everything again. It is important to note this only saves the weights, which is why in the final test program there is some code taken directly from this program that is largely unchanged. They create the same neural network, it just needs to load the weights for each node.

Before running the program ensure that the directories named "Validate" and "Test" are in the same directory as the program. Results may varry. The output is a set of weights representing the neural network known as "Classy.h5"

# Binary_Image_Classification_Frame_Parser
This program exists to parse the frames from a set of video files into two categories, "Pose" and "Std" which stands for standard. I kept the files in a directory called "Video_CV_Project_3" and each file was named something allong the lines of "MOVI00" followed by a 2 digit number. Change these if that doesn't match your setup. Be advised that it will continue to attempt to read MOVI00## files until it has reached the number specified by condition of the first while loop (num < 1)
